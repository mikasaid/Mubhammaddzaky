CodeIgniter Website
This is the unofficial informational website for the CodeIgniter project, rewritten using CodeIgniter4. This website is not deployed - it is intended to be a proof-of-concept and testbed for the CodeIgniter4 rewrite.

The website has been open-sourced in the interest of transparency. We welcome issues and pull requests, to handle suggestions or corrections to the style or structure of the website. We will be a bit more reserved with the content :-/

The migration process, converting the CodeIgniter website from CodeIgniter3 to CodeIgniter4, is explained, step by step, in this writeup.
